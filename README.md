Data Description:
High-quality financial data of US based stocks and ETFs trading on the NASDAQ MKT.  A stock market, equity market or share market is the aggregation of buyers and sellers (a loose network of economic transactions, not a physical facility or discrete entity) of stocks (also called shares), which represent ownership claims on businesses;   these may include securities listed on a public stock exchange, as well as stock that is only traded privately.

ABSTRACT: 
In finance, market data is price and trade-related data for a financial instrument reported by a trading venue such as a stock exchange. Market data allows traders and investors to know the latest price and see historical trends for instruments such as equities, fixed-income products, derivatives, and currencies.
Tableau visualizes and analyzes millions of rows of stock data effortlessly. It was built without any programming by a regular business user. Tableau empowers people to ask and answer their own questions of the data at the speed of thought. Digging deeper into the data is as easy as dragging and dropping, pointing and clicking. 
Open-High-Low-Close attributes used to illustrate movements in the price of a financial instrument over time. High and low price indicates the highest and lowest stock price on the date whereas open and close indicates the opening and closing price on the same day.
A candlestick is a type of price chart used that displays the high, low, open and closing prices of a security for a specific period. It originated from Japanese rice merchants and traders to track market prices and daily momentum hundreds of years before becoming popularized in the United States. The wide part of the candlestick is called the "real body" and tells investors whether the closing price was higher or lower than the opening price (black/red if the stock closed lower, white/green if the stock closed higher).
